Documenting my studies: https://galhardo-dev.netlify.app

I know somethings about:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, and AdonisJS
- PHP, Wordpress, Laravel
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Redis
- Software Engineering (Clean Code, MVC, 12FactorApp, Unit Tests, TDD, etc)
- DevOps (Apache, NGINX, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Linux, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL, JSON, JWT, Oauth2, Postman, Stripe, etc)

I also have interest to learn and work with Elixir (PhoenixFramework/Gigalixir), Golang and React Native.

The more I study and learn, the less I know. And the less I know, the more I want to know. This is probably what motivates me the most in life.
