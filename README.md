I know somethings about:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, and AdonisJS
- PHP, Wordpress, Laravel
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Redis
- Software Engineering (Clean Code, MVC, 12FactorApp, Unit Tests, TDD, etc)
- DevOps (Apache, NGINX, Docker, Git, Linux, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL, JSON, JWT, Oauth2, Postman, Stripe, etc)

I also have interest to learn and work with Elixir (PhoenixFramework/Gigalixir) and React Native.

In my spare time, I like to play videogames, read books, play sports, watch good movies and tv shows, talk and learn cool things from interesting people, and of course, program personal projects :b

I'm not fluent in english (speaking) yet, but I understand a lot reading and listening.
